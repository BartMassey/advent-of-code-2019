# Advent of Code 2019: Day 16
Bart Massey

…aaand I'm done with Advent of Code. Part 1 was
straightforward enough, if fiddly. It took me about 1.5
hours to generate some reasonable, clean code.

When Part 2 came up, it was obvious that I couldn't just
brute force it unless I wanted to wait at least
overnight. It was also clear that some mildly clever modulo
arithmetic stuff was intended, taking advantage of the
periodicity in the patterns to make Part 2 run in about the
same time as Part 1.

I started to write that code.

Then I lost the will to continue. It would have been at
least another 1.5 hours, and I still haven't finished the
persnickety Day 14 solution yet.

If I am going to do this again, it will be because there are
nice problems every single night that a reasonably competent
programmer like myself can solve in less than two hours for
both parts. I don't need a Christmas Project — I need a
Christmas Recreation.

Enough.
