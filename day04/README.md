# Advent of Code 2019: Day 4
Bart Massey

This felt easier than some previous puzzles. My current
solution is pretty slow and gross, so I will clean it up a
bit.

For some reason I am using a lot more functional-programming
stuff in my Rust this year.

This is the first puzzle with no text file for input. For
these, I will simple paste the given input into a text file
manually; it works better with my machinery and is more
consistent.

Run with

    cargo run --release 1 <input.txt
    cargo run --release 2 <input.txt
