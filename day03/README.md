# Advent of Code 2019: Day 3
Bart Massey

That took a lot longer than I hoped â€” about four hours to
produce a cleaned-up solution. To be fair, I cleaned up a
lot of machinery and polished the code quite a bit after
successfully submitting.

Part 2 was more of a pain than I thought it should have
been, because I was trying to be efficient and to use `std`
and `libaoc` where reasonable.

I wrote in a mostly functional-programming style this
time. I'm not sure how much better that was than just
writing the thing imperatively. I was pretty confident of
correctness when the compiler accepted my code, and my tests
passed on the first try, so there was that.
