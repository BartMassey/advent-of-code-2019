# Advent of Code 2019: Day 13
Bart Massey

That was actually fun! Nice quick little thing with a fun
display.

Ended up with quite a bit of new infrastructure in `libaoc`.

Cute problem.

Solution to
[this problem](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/13).

Save your problem input to `input.txt` and run with

    cargo run --release 1 <input.txt
    cargo run --release 2 <input.txt

If you add an optional delay argument in milliseconds to
Part 2, the game will be rendered with that delay between
characters printed (once the board is drawn and play
starts). Pleasing values seem to be in the 1..20 range.
