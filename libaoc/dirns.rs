//! Directions management for Advent of Code solutions.
//!
//! To use this, make a new `GridBox` to set clipping bounds,
//! then call the `neighbors()` method of the `ClipBox` to get
//! an iterator over clipped neighbors in cardinal directions.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```rust
//! use aoc::dirns::*;
//!
//! let clip_box = GridBox::new(3, 4);
//! let neighbors = clip_box.neighbors((2, 0))
//!                 .collect::<Vec<_>>();
//! assert_eq!(neighbors, vec![(1, 0), (2, 1)]);
//! ```
